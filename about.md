My name is **Michal Sakowicz** and I'm a software developer living in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm lucky enough that it's not only my job but also one of my hobbies. I like to play around with technology I love learning, solving problems and building new things.  I'm very much into software design, tools and process automation I hate seeing a human doing a computer's job.  This is my personal blog where I sometimes write about topics related to my profession. 

My resume is available on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michalsakowicz "Michal profile on LinkedIn").
